## Create a new variable

1) Read in the birthweight data
2) Create a new variable `lbw` with these conditions
  - if `bweight<2500` then `lbw is Weight<2500` 
  - if `bweight>=2500` then `lbw is Normal 2500+` 
  
  
## GGplot

1) Do a boxplot of `lbw` vs `gestwks` and use classic theme
2) Do a boxplot of `lbw` vs `gestwks` and use classic theme and `facet` by `agegrp`
